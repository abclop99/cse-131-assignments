Assigned compilers: 62, 36

- For each compiler
        - Tracing the compiler
                - Choose 2 programs that run successfully
                        - The programs should use
                                - Loop that runs several times and terminates
                                - At least 2 different binary operators
                                - `input`
                        - For each program
                                - Show 3 relevant code snippets from the compiler that are critical to its compilation
                                        - Ex: data structures used in the type checker, etc.
                                        - Different snippets unless interestingly different behavior
        - Bugs, Missing features, and Design Decisions
                - Choose a program that has a different behavior than it should (works wrong)
                        - If key feature unimplemented
                                - Describe how you would add it
                                - TODO
                        - If implemented, but error
                                - Describe how to fix
                                - TODO
                        - If implemented, but wrong
                                - Decide if it is a reasonable design decision
                                        - If makes design easier/simpler, identify how
                                        - If bug, how to fix
                                        - If better design than chosen for Cobra
                - if perfectly implemented
                        - Explain what tested
                        - Why confident that it's correct
        - Lessons and Advice
                - Answer
                        - Identify decision made in compiler that's different from yours
                                - Describe one way it's better
                        - Identify decision made in compiler that's different from yours
                                - Describe one way it's worse
                        - One improvement to make in mine after seeing it
                        - One improvement recommended to author of compiler
- Hand-in
        - PDF
        - Pages for 1st compiler, followed by pages for 2nd compiler
                - Start review of 2nd compiler on a new page
